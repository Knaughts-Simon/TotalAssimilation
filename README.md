Assimilation does more.

Specifically:
1. All biologically ascended empires can now assimilate organic pops (including cyborgs). Previously, only biologically ascended hive minds could assimilate.
2. Psionically ascended empires can now assimilate cyborgs (There's still a soul in there, just tear out all the metal bits!)
3. Synthetically ascended empires can now assimilate other machines. Previously, they could only assimilate organics. (No reason we can't build a better shell, and upload the alien intelligence into it!)
4. **Most impactfully**, biologically and psionically ascended empires assimilate by replacement, rather than by adding traits. This functions much the same way synthetically ascended empires normally assimilate.

### Installation
Since citizenship types and living standards are hard-coded into the game, we needed to overwrite three vanilla objects. This means the mod needs to be low in your load-list, and that it will conflict with any other mods that override these objects.

```
assimilation_effect
citizenship_assimilation
living_standard_psi_assimilation
```

### Feedback
Please leave feedback in the comments. It's likely I made some silly mistakes, since this is my first Stellaris mod.
