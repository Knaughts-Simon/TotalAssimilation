Assimilation does more.

Specifically:
1. All biologically ascended empires can now assimilate organic pops (including cyborgs). Previously, only biologically ascended hive minds could assimilate.
2. Psionically ascended empires can now assimilate cyborgs (There's still a soul in there, just tear out all the metal bits!)
3. Synthetically ascended empires can now assimilate other machines. Previously, they could only assimilate organics. (No reason we can't build a better shell, and upload the alien intelligence into it!)
4. **Most impactfully**, biologically and psionically ascended empires assimilate by replacement, rather than by adding traits. This functions much the same way synthetically ascended empires normally assimilate.
