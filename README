Assimilation does more.

Specifically:
[olist]
    [*]As soon as you can [b]Assimilate[/b] any species, you can [b]Total Assimilate[/b] every species. Yes, this includes Determined Exterminator (after they adopt Synthetics).
    [*]Total Assimilation is by replacement rather than by modifying traits. This functions much the same way synthetically ascended empires normally assimilate.
[/olist]

For easier compatibility, there are two other minor differences between the Citizenship Types [b]Assimilation[/b] and [b]Total Assimilation[/b]:
[olist]
    [*]Total Assimilation does not contribute to planetary revolts.
    [*]Total Assimilation pops may leave as refugees if land is appropriated.
    [*]Total Assimilation pops may have normal Living Standards while assimilating.
[/olist]

[h2]Installation[/h2]

Since this mod creates all new objects, it should not conflict with any other mod.

[h2]Feedback[/h2]

Feedback is quite welcome in the comments, but look at Known Issues below, first.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Since these are minor and/or nontrivial to fix, I have no immediate plans to fix them. Let me know in comments if it particularly irks you.

[list]
    [*]The Driven Assimilator Colossus weapon, Nanobot Diffuser, is implemented completely independently from assimilation, so its immediate effect is unaffected by this mod. That means it kills drones, and converts organics to cyborgs. These cyborgs can be converted, gradually, into the primary species of the Driven Assimilator. Ideally, the weapon would have the same effect as assimilation: converting all pops to the primary species.
    [*]The Total Assimilation Living Standard is visible (but not selectable until you qualify) from the beginning of the game. This has no mechanical effect, and makes the mod slightly easier to maintain.
