Assimilation does more.

Specifically:
[olist]
    [*]As soon as you can assimilate any species, you can assimilate every species.
    [*]All assimilation is by replacement rather than by modifying traits. This functions much the same way synthetically ascended empires normally assimilate.
[/olist]

[h2]Installation[/h2]

Since citizenship types and living standards are hard-coded into the game, we needed to overwrite three vanilla objects. This means the mod needs to be low in your load-list, and that it will conflict with any other mods that override these objects.

[code]
assimilation_effect
citizenship_assimilation
living_standard_psi_assimilation
[/code]

If you're running a mod that overrides any of these, try using [url=https://bcssov.github.io/IronyModManager/]Irony Mod Manager[/url] to resolve the conflict.

[h2]Feedback[/h2]

Feedback is welcome in the comments, but look at Known Issues below, first.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Since these are minor and/or nontrivial to fix, I have no immediate plans to fix them. Let me know in comments if it particularly irks you.

[list]
    [*]Driven Assimilators who follow the Cybernetics ascension path will regret it, since assimilation converts pops to the machine species, not the cyborg species.
    [*]Driven Assimilators immediately start converting their cyborgs into robots; this is intended, but ideally they would start the game with all robots.
    [*]The Driven Assimilator Colossus weapon, Nanobot Diffuser, is implemented completely independently from assimilation, so its immediate effect is unaffected by this mod. That means it kills drones, and converts organics to cyborgs. These cyborgs can be converted, gradually, into the primary species of the Driven Assimilator. Ideally, the weapon would have the same effect as assimilation: converting all pops to the primary species.
    [*]Hive Minds and Driven Assimilator Machine Empires have two redundant Living Standards: Identity Sublimation and Mutative Assimilation. One of these should be removed, and neither of them make sense when assimilating a Drone from another Hive Mind. As mentioned above, there should probably be a new Living Standard for this situation, with increased Deviancy.
