Assimilation does more.

[olist]
    [*]In general, as soon as you can [b]Assimilate[/b] any species, you can [b]Total Assimilate[/b] every species. See specifics below.
    [*]Total Assimilation is by replacement rather than by modifying traits. This functions much the same way synthetically ascended empires normally assimilate.
[/olist]

Specifically, you can Total Assimilate any species into your primary species when one of these is true:
[olist]
    [*]You are a Driven Assimilator
    [*]You have completed the special project for synthetic evolution 
    [*]You have the tradition Engineered Genesis, from the genetic ascension path
    [*]You have the tradition Transubstantiation Synthesis, from the cybernetics ascension path (and the synthetic path for machines, if you lack the Machine Age DLC)
    [*]You have the tradition Great Awakening, from the psionic ascension path
    [*]You've finished the Nanotech tradition tree, one of the Machine Age DLC ascension paths for machines
    [*]You've finished the Modularity tradition tree, one of the Machine Age DLC ascension paths for machines
    [*]You've finished the Virtuality tradition tree, one of the Machine Age DLC ascension paths for machines
[/olist]


For easier compatibility, there are four other minor differences between the Citizenship Types [b]Assimilation[/b] and [b]Total Assimilation[/b]:
[olist]
    [*]Total Assimilation does not contribute to planetary revolts.
    [*]Total Assimilation will [i]not[/i] cause a breach of the Universal Prosperity Mandate resolution, unlike Identity Sublimation.
    [*]Total Assimilation pops may leave as refugees if land is appropriated.
    [*]Total Assimilation pops may have normal Living Standards while assimilating.

[h2]Installation[/h2]

Since this mod creates all new objects, it should not conflict with any other mod.

[h2]Feedback[/h2]

Feedback is quite welcome in the comments, but look at Known Issues below, first.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Since these are minor and/or nontrivial to fix, I have no immediate plans to fix them. Let me know in comments if it particularly irks you.

[list]
    [*]The Driven Assimilator Colossus weapon, Nanobot Diffuser, is implemented completely independently from assimilation, so its immediate effect is unaffected by this mod. That means it kills drones, and converts organics to cyborgs. These cyborgs can be converted, gradually, into the primary species of the Driven Assimilator via Total Assimilation.
    [*]The Total Assimilation Living Standard is visible (but not selectable until you qualify) from the beginning of the game. This has no mechanical effect, and makes the mod slightly easier to maintain.
